        The Todo List app allows you to easily manage your daily tasks by adding
        and removing to-dos. You can add a new task with a title and
        description, and it will be stored in the list for easy reference. Once
        you've completed a task, you can delete it from the list to keep things
        organized. The app also saves your tasks locally, so even if you refresh
        the page, your to-dos will remain intact. It's a simple and effective
        way to stay on top of your daily work!
